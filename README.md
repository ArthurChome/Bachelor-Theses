A Framework for Mixed Reality

For my 3rd Bachelor Computer Science, my theses revolved around developing a framework to develop Mixed Reality games.
This project contains programming resources such a TCP server, a keyword manager for voice command recognition and all toolkits to allow for spatial awareness and object tracking.
The server and keyword manager are both compatible on the Unity editor and on the Microsoft HoloLens.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my advisor Payam. He gave me great feedback for completing my research paper every week again and this in spite of his other responsibilities as a PhD student. I had no experience in writing a formal research paper and gathering good references proved to be tricky at times. Luckily, Payam gave me good advice at every step of the process to prevent rooky mistakes. He was a great advisor overall.

The same can be said about Ahmed. He gave good recommendations and showed great patience when mistakes occurred. He also introduced me to LateX\footnote{\protect\url{https://www.latex-project.org/}}, Google Scholar\footnote{\protect\url{https://scholar.google.be/}} and many more handy tools for writing a paper. In short, a very good advisor.

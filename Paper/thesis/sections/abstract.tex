\section*{Abstract}
In this thesis, we propose a framework for the navigation of virtual agents in a dynamic robotic Mixed Reality environment. It will allow virtual objects to recognize and track a physical robot using spacial mapping. Even in movement, the virtual content should be properly mapped on that object. As a technical evaluation of our framework, we will develop a Mixed Reality robotic game based on it. In this game, the user can steer a robot with a head-mounted device using voice commands with virtual content being mapped on the controlled device.

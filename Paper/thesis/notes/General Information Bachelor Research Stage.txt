TIPS PAYAM:
-Research papers MUST be of high quality.
-Your first goal is to find if the work you do exists or not.
-Prove to me: real problem + nobody solved it.
-Robot navigation based on VR headset is something new.
-Formulate a problem statement: can you make an open project for researchers
 to easily build this.
 => Close source: source is not open: you have to pay,... Can't have source code,...
 => Open source: you get everything: source code,... To help people started.
-What if it's open source?

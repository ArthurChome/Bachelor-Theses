RoboMR: A Mixed Reality Robotic Game - README
This folder contains all packages and resources for our navigation framework

SCRIPTS
All written scripts (code) for our navigation framework.
They each offer different functionality and all have to be included 
within a Unity scene in order to work completely.

TOOLKITS
In order to implement the framework, we made use of online toolkits:
-HoloToolkit: for building the Mixed Reality application on the HoloLens.
 It gets installed automatically when opening a new project.
-Vuforia: for object tracking and positioning virtual information on a target

HOLOGRAMS
The framework needs virtual objects to position 
on the target objects to track in the environment.

SCANS
The folder has a 3D scan of a Lego Mindstorms robot.
